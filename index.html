          <p>
          As a Human-Computer Interaction University Associate Professor I was delighted with the new edition of Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction (5th Edition).
It was entirely renewed and fully updated.
I have shared this textbook with my HCI undergraduate and graduate HCI students this semester and they liked it a lot and found it touches well and thoroughly current HCI issues!
Ben Shneiderman and Catherine Plaisant present and discuss timely most key HCI theories, concepts, ideas and applications.
I strongly recommend this book for academic and professional HCI courses.

 The 5th edition thoroughly updates and improves this valuable resource for students, professionals, and researchers interested in human-computer interaction. The presentation's coherent depth and breadth clarify how the interface mediates our access to information, and the need to match its design to our cognitive and perceptual capabilities. I was especially pleased that my colleagues Shneiderman and Plaisant included a chapter on information visualization also providing a rich list of references on this and other related fields. They make a convincing case for development of new information visualization evaluation tools. The 5th symphony, I meant edition, made me better aware of how mobile devices are changing our world and of the increasing power of YouTube, flickr and other social media. This is a great book!
